# SpotifyPlaylist

This script allows the user to analyze their Spotify playlists by plotting each song's metadata.

This script requires some sensitive client info in order to access their Spotify account.
I've protected my Client ID and Client Secret Key by storing them in a separate class.

The Client ID and Client Secret Key can be obtained from Spotify by creating a Spotify Developer account.
Both Client IDs and Secret Keys are a string of alphanumerics that resemble "as645dfasdfasd45646asdf4asf654"

Dependancies:
-Python 3
-Spotify Account
-Spotify Developer app secret key
-Custom class called clientCredentials where user credentials are stored
